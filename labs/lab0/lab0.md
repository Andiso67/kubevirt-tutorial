## Overview

### Abstract

KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The aim is to provide a common ground for virtualization solutions on top of Kubernetes.

This lab is targeted towards people who donâ€™t have OCP or KubeVirt experience. If you have a lot of OCP, there will be some review.

The goal is to show you how to run KubeVirt locally and get a bit familiar with it.

We will use a dedicated VM on GCP per student (No Gcp knowledge is required)

### Lab Overview

* Explore an OpenShift environment by running some basic commands
* Deploy an application on OpenShift
* Deploy and explore KubeVirt
* Deploy a virtual machine using Kubevirt
* Access the virtual machine
* Deploy CDI and create a vm using it
* Create vms with multiple nics by using Multus
* Deploy and Use Kubevirt UI

### Requirements

- Laptop with a modern browser for OCP console
- SSH client
